        "description": "I wanted to make the short version at first, but then I got carried away by the beautiful chords this song has, and I've been a Gen Hoshino's fan for a while so I thought this was a good opportunity to bring one of his songs to the channel.\nThis one took Famitracker to its absolute limit at some parts, I even had to use a technique called instrument juggling, which is basically when a melody moves from one channel to another in order to be completey played instead of cut before it ends due to channel limitations. So yeah, this one was quite the experience for me, hope you like it!\n\nFor those who are asking, this IS NOT 16-bit, it's 8-bit with an expansion chip added, and said chip could be found in some Japanese NES cartridges like Castlevania for instance.\n\n*Pixel art by EmaDArt: https://twitter.com/EmaDArt7/status/1519750483027578880\n*Background animation by me!\n*Song produced by me in Famitracker 0cc",
