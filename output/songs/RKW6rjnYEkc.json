Please credit me in your description. I had to deal with too many thieves & false claims, so to protect my work, you might get a pre-emptive claim from my friends at State51. If you wish to monetize on YT, or would like to purchase a commercial license, please reach out via email. \n\nAlso. Backstory of the song: during the 2019 contest hosted by Discord, people were making all sorts of cool fanart and bots. There was even a Music category, which is the one I wanted to compete in. The prize was literally just 1 year of nitro and some merch, so nobody else really took it as seriously, but I saw an opportunity and I went all out. Since we only had 4 days to make something, I was in a hurry. You can tell because of wacky decisions like the fact that the BPM of the song is 142.86 (lmao). I remember wanting the discord ping sound effect to sync perfectly with the grid. Unfortunately I didn't even end up winning the prize, but it still paid off to put in the work! I got blessed by the youtube algorithm a few months later, and now I have my dream music career. Thank you all ^^\n\nAlso! Ping 2 dropped: https://youtu.be/8CYy9jNmpXM \n\n#exyl #discord",
