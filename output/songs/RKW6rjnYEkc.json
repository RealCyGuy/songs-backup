Tried to troll ppl with the use of discord sounds, combining it with my style of music to weave in cool riffs and clean mixing. I am extremely grateful to all of you guys for the support, it came at a dark time in my life when I was seriously doubting pursuing music anymore. Special thanks to Zencha, a former staff member at Discord, who picked my song as a honorable mention in the Discord Hackweek 2019 contest. Without his seemingly insignificant decision, the YouTube algorithm would have never noticed me. Lastly, I really want you guys to watch ping 2, I've been working on it for a very long time and I truly think it lives up to the beast that this song was!
