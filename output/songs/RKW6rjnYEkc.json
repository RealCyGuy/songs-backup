The annoying notification sound, lowering your expectations for what's to come, turning into an angry chord progression of sorts, and detonating into a banger that catches you off guard! I am still in wonder of what exactly allowed this song to reach such heights of success. Many creative decisions came together perfectly to make this song work so well. I am extremely grateful to all of you guys for the support, it came at a dark time in my life when I was seriously doubting pursuing music anymore. Special thanks to Zencha, a former staff member at Discord, who picked my song as a honorable mention in the Discord Hackweek 2019 contest. Without this seemingly small feature, perhaps the YT algorithm could have never detected me  =)\n\n#Exyl #FLUTEGANG",
