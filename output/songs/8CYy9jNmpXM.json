        "description": "IM BACK BABY. I'VE LEVELED UP.\n\nThis is a huge project for me. I went all out on the song and animation =)\nBack in Ping 1, the flute part was just goofy text spelling out \"F L U T E\"... I lacked the skill to animate actual flute-playing. I've come a long way since! What you'll find here is a culmination of my progress in composition, music theory, 3D design, and character animation. A new chapter for me as an artist.\nWallpapers and merch: https://exyl.shop/\n\n\ud835\udc08   \u2009\u2009\u200a\u200a\u200a\u25cf Can I use this song for YouTube or Twitch? Yes use it!
