Yes use it! Please credit me in your description. I had to deal with too many thieves & false claims, so to protect my work, you might get a pre-emptive claim from my friends at State51.

The OG ping was a bit of a mess that I made for a contest, but this? This has actual LORE related to flutes and Discord. A new beginning for my channel. Discord is pretty much my home now. I would be nothing without them, and they're really supporting of this project, big shoutout to them. I used FL Studio 20 for the song, and Blender for all of the visuals. Tutorials coming over the next few weeks! I'm eager to show you my secrets and my workflow when creating something like this.\n\n#Exyl #Complextro #FLUTEGANG",
