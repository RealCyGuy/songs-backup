        "description": "GO TO 1080 HD QUALITY FOR THE BEST VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY POSSIBLE!!!\n\nHey everyone!\n\nContrary to every other video, this weeks video wasn't requested by any of our awesome subscribers. Since we love the song so much, we made 'September' by Earth, Wind & Fire in Minecraft note blocks. We also used 20 different tracks in Minecraft Note Block Studio with 8 different note block sounds to capture the entire beauty of this song. We really hope you enjoy it, because it took a lot of effort to make!\n\nHow this was made:\n\n1. The note block song was created 100% by ear with no help from midi files whatsoever in a program called 'Minecraft note block studio' (download link below).\n\n2. The note block song was exported as a '.schematic' file.\n\n3. The schematic file was placed into a Minecraft world using a program called 'MCEdit' (download link below).\n\n4. An MCEdit filter was applied to the giant redstone note block contraption to make note blocks turn into command blocks.\n\n5. These command blocks were then set to spawn the note blocks in the area shown in the video in the correct spots at the correct time.\n\n6. The wireless note block song was then recorded with 'Fraps' (download link below).\n\n7. Next, the recording was placed into an editing software called 'Sony Vegas Pro 11' (download link below) and was edited together with some other pictures and videos to make the video you will or have watched.\n\nKeep in mind that the recording was sped up/slowed down to match the original song's speed. Also, we were able to get the 'vocal' sound by replacing the 'chime.ogg' sound with the 'pling.ogg' sound in the .minecraft sound directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nSUBSCRIBE TO SEE MORE!\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1NGU0rF\n\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/1YGTKus\n\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/1l6U0F1\n\nSoundCloud: http://bit.ly/1QdoY9u\n\nMerch: http://bit.ly/1O2Qli0\n\nBonus Channel: http://bit.ly/1Q086o5\n\nIntro: http://maclobuzz.wix.com/maclobuzz\n\nMinecraft: https://minecraft.net/\n\nMinecraft Note Block Studio: http://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs\n\nMCEdit: http://www.mcedit.net/\n\nFraps: http://fraps.com/\n\nSony Vegas Pro: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro\n\nGLSL Shaders Mod: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286604-shaders-mod-updated-by-karyonix\n\nStay tuned for an amazing new video every week!",
