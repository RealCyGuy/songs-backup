        "description": "Sheet Music \u2192 https://mymusic.st/animenzzz/78176\n\nThe much anticipated anime of Chainsaw Man is finally airing this season! And it starts with a banger of a song: \"KICK BACK\" from Kenshi Yonezu - definitely one of the catchiest songs I have heard in a while. \n\nNot only does \"KICK BACK\" has a crazy amount of key changes, it also has one of the most epic mood changes I have ever heard. The music in 1:41 suddenly changes from utterly \"dark and chaotic\" into extremely \"bright and hopeful\" and for a brief moment, I felt like I was walking in musical heaven. Amazing moment.\n\n\u2460 Chainsaw and a fist... on the piano?\nDid you notice the left hand glissando at the very beginning in 0:01? I actually tried to imitate the sound of a Chainsaw, similar to the original song. Likewise, this arrangement also ends with a glissando again in 3:08, bringing the song to a full circle. \n\nI also used my fist in 2:06 for the first time to hammer down the chord for maximum dynamic power. But needless to say, you shouldn't overdo it or else the strings of the piano might break, haha.\n\n\u2461 Chaos in the rhythm\nThe most difficult part to arrange was actually the \"\u52aa\u529b\u30fb\u672a\u6765\u30fbA BEAUTIFUL STAR\" in the beginning, because there are multiple rhythms overlapping with each other. On top of that, I also used octaves in the left hand because I wanted to create a punchy bass line for this arrangement. I also used a lot of staccato during the chorus in 0:51 to further accentuate the chaotic atmosphere of the song.\n\n\u2462 The string orchestra appears!\nAs mentioned earlier above, the sudden musical contrast in 1:41 was simply brilliant and I am pretty sure the arranger of the original song - Tsuneta Daiki from King Gnu - had a huge influence here, since he loves to include beautiful string instruments in King Gnu's music. \n\nI tried to mirror it on the piano as well by letting the right hand play an additional layer of melody in 1:41 to sound like strings from a orchestra. This is also one of the rare cases where the left hand is able to play both the melody and the bass at the same time (with only minimal help from the right hand), resulting in an almost \"perfect\" three hand technique. \n\nAlright, thank you for reading my \"Animenz explains\" column for this arrangement! \"KICK BACK\" is a really amazing song and no matter how often I repeat it, it simply never gets boring. I hope you could find the same chaos of \"kicking back\" (the phenomenon of bouncing back vigorously while using a chainsaw) in this piano arrangement too!\n\nThe fact that MAPPA makes different ED songs each week with top tier Japanese artists also shows their dedication to the Chainsaw Man anime. We truly live in the best timeline. \n\nWell then, I will continue working on my 2M medley project! The special medley is scheduled to be uploaded in early December! \n\nSee you next time again!\nAnimenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\nSocial Media\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/Animenzzz\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/animenz_official/\nFacebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Animenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\nAnimenz Sheet Music\n\nOfficial Animenz Sheet Music Book (Published by YAMAHA)\nhttps://animenz-shop.com/\nDigital Sheet Music:\nhttps://www.mymusicsheet.com/animenzzz/\n-----*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n\ud83c\udfb9Piano arrangement by Animenz\n\nOriginal Song: KICK BACK\nAnime: Chainsaw Man / \u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\nPublished by: Sony Music Labels Inc.\nComposed by: Kenshi Yonezu\nPerformed by: Kenshi Yonezu\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n#chainsawman #kenshiyonezu #kickback",
