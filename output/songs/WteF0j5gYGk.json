Sound of Silence Parody https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsFjpCKhP0Q&t=182s\nTobuscus Music Playlist! - http://bit.ly/Musicbuscus\nNew Tobuscus Animated Music Video - https://youtu.be/G4_T1g_CR9k?list=PLjMyftFeAnd2gHV5KRb0g3i5b22zNiOsh\n\nFacebook! http://facebook.com/tobuscus\nDaily Vlogs: http://youtube.com/tobyturner\nTobyGames! http://bit.ly/TobyGames\nTwitter! http://twitter.com/tobyturner\nSnapchat! Chatbuscus\n\nThanks to Terabrite for mixing the audio and color correction, Patrick Mazzalo for After Effects, Olga Kay for filming, and myself for singing and playing piano\n\nLYRICS:\n\nThis song sounds dramatic\nbut I'm bad at writing words.\nIf you don't speak English,\nthis probably sounds pretty good.\n\nYou'd probably think I'm singing\nbout some pretty serious stuff.\nBut in reality, I'm singing 'bout \nthe lack of stuff i'm singing 'bout.\n\nThis part's intense. \nAnd emotional.\nAs long as you don't understand it.\n\nYour foreign grandma \nwould love this song.\n\nPlease send it to her, \nand she'll probably tell her\nforeign friends about the song her \ngrandson or daughter sent her today.\n\nThis song might hit the charts in her country\nif parts sounded like Coldplay.\n\nIf the chorus sounds like Coldplay.\n\nThen I put some 'La-La-La's in there.\nLa la la la la, \nla la la la la la la (Coldplay)\n\nHopefully your foreign grandma\nlistens to this song everyday.\nAnd if she asks you to \ntranslate the lyrics, here's what you say:\n\n\"A perfect translation does not exist.\nWell, at least, not in your language.\nBut if you must know, well, picture this:\nFifty billion rainbows,\nand the sun is setting,\nand the moon is setting, also,\nand you're there in a gazebo.\nAnd then God descends from heaven\nand He gives you a million dollars.\nTake that feeling,\nand put it into a song.\nI could translate word by word,\nbut that'd take too long.\nAnd I've got stuff to do grandma.\nI don't have time for this.\nYou've gotta trust me grandma,\nthis freakin' song is brilliant.\"\n\n\u00a9 2012 Tobuscus",
