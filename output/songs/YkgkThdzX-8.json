The first verse came to me very quickly in the form of a childlike street chant \u2018da da da da da dee dee da dee da ee a eeeh\u2019. The piano intro I\u2019ve had hanging around in my head for a few years \u2013 the chords and melody followed naturally from this. \n\nThe middle eight was \u2018conceived\u2019 to finish off the song. I think it works as a song. Of course, there is always room for improvement \u2013 otherwise I wouldn\u2019t make any more. The third verse came to me in an eight-seater plane. It\u2019s a song for children.\n\nYoko: \u2018Cloud Piece\u2019: \u2018Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\u2019 This is not a piece of poetry. Poetry to me is nouns or adjectives. This is verbs. And you have to do them. These are all instructions and when you just do it, then you start to understand it.\n\nJohn: \u2018Imagine\u2019 was inspired by Yoko\u2019s Grapefruit. There\u2019s a lot of pieces in it saying like \u2018Imagine this\u2019 or \u2018Imagine that\u2019. If you get a copy of Grapefruit and look through, you\u2019ll see where I was influenced by her. \u2018Imagine\u2019 could never have been written without her. And I know she helped on a lot of the lyrics but I wasn\u2019t man enough to let her have credit for it. So that song was actually written by John & Yoko, but I was still selfish enough and unaware enough to take her contribution without acknowledging it. The song itself expresses what I\u2019d learned through being with Yoko and my own feelings on it. It should really have said \u2018Lennon/Ono\u2019 on that song, because she contributed a lot of that song.\n\nAlan White (drummer): Every song we did on Imagine, John would make us read the lyrics and insist that we understood the meaning of the song before started playing it. That had quite an impact for me.\n\nKlaus Voormann (bass): When we played \u2018Imagine\u2019 and heard the lyrics, the possibility that this was going to be such a big song was apparent. It definitely was. I even thought I didn\u2019t want to play on it because it was so amazing with just John playing piano. It was so true and honest. That would have been enough. I hope you\u2019ve got a version of just John playing it.\n\nPhil McDonald (engineer): \u2018Imagine\u2019 was one of the easiest tracks to record, almost all live, in a few takes. We mixed the track at Tittenhurst and Phil Spector added strings on top of the stereo tape in the USA.\n\nYoko: John and I were both artists and we were living together, so we inspired each other. And the song \u2018Imagine\u2019 embodied what we believed together at the time. John and I met \u2013 he comes from the West and I come from the East \u2013 and still we are together. We have this oneness and \u2018the whole world would eventually become one\u2019 is the sense that we will all be caf\u00e9-au-lait colour and we will all be very happy together. All these instructions are for people for how to spend eternity, because we have lots of time.\n\nJohn: If you can imagine a world of peace, if you can imagine a world with no denominations of religion \u2013 not without religion, whatever religion is \u2013 but without this divisive \u2018My god is bigger than your god\u2019 business.... Then, if you can imagine the possibility, then it can be true.\n\nYoko: \u2018Imagine\u2019 is a complete vision. A succinct bible of truth. It will start to unfold as you believe in it. The film? Well, it just happened naturally. I was well aware of the symbolism of everything \u2013 closing and then opening the shutters to let the light in. It\u2019s rather personal, but I had a definite reason why I smiled at the end, in addition to loving being next to John.\n\nImagine The Ultimate Collection: Explore and enjoy the IMAGINE album and the 1971 Ascot Sound Studios & Record Plant Sessions like you\u2019ve never seen or heard them before.\n\nFind out more: http://imaginejohnyoko.com\nVideo from Lennon Legend DVD: http://bit.ly/lenleg \nJL Videos on iTunes: http://apple.co/2hIilCu\n\nhttp://www.johnlennon.com",
