When I heard RADWIMPS' cover of it, I knew I had to sing it at some point, so here it is. Enjoy!\n\nMusic: RADWIMPS\nVocals/Mixing: Will Stetson\nEditing: Ed Ho\nLyrics: David Toth\n\nMy Gear \u2193\u2193\u2193\nBlue Compass Boom Arm: https://amzn.to/38twvhV\nBlue Baby Bottle Condenser Mic: https://amzn.to/3ak2FxT\nAKG P120 Condenser Mic: https://amzn.to/3afgCgu\nShure SM58 Dynamic Mic: https://amzn.to/38hKsPF\nScarlett 4i4 Audio Interface: https://amzn.to/2u6HdvH\nScarlett Solo Audio Interface: https://amzn.to/2txeyQm\nBlue 10-FT XLR Cable: https://amzn.to/2Ru9gNB\n\nLyrics:\nI wonder if you\u2019ve opened your eyes?\nCause it seems that even so your far off gaze will never cross with mine.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late again\u2026\u201d you shouted at me\nEven though I ran with all my might to see you smiling beautifully.\nSeems this heart of mine had gotten here before I even knew to leave.\n\nJust to see your face, your hair, your eyes, before me standing there it hurts me so\nJust to breathe with you and live in this moment is fine and I won\u2019t let it go.\nTo the voice that has been calling me since ever so long ago\nJust what is it I\u2019ll say to you when first we\u2019ll meet to let you know\n\nFor countless lives gone by I\u2019ve searching for you before either of us two had been born\nI never forgot that awkward smile you showed me it\u2019s been pushing me on even to this day.\nAnd if you lose your way from the path you came and scatter far along the wind\nI swear that I\u2019ll find you somewhere so we can always share together this life we\u2019re in.\nOr wipe it away destroy the path that we came and start this world all over again.\n\nWhere oh where here should I begin\nTo tell you all of the things you missed while you were still off sleeping in?\nThis story spans for thousands of years\nIt\u2019s a story of the two of us that finally has brought us here.\nI can see your shape reflected in these eyes of mine now crystal clear.\n\nWant to joke around and play and laugh with a you far away you\u2019ve never met\nI will hold you ever close to me and smile through all the pain and regret\nEven though the stars and time had pushed us so far away\nWe met and I will hold your hand to keep you close and make you stay.\n\nFor countless lives gone by I\u2019ve searching for you before either of us two had been born\nI heard all the tears you cried alone in the dark and followed on to try and wipe away that fear.\nBut we are here right now and the world will change cause not a single thing could stand in our way.\nIf I were to lose you I would never give up and start along on the road again.\nBecause in an instant you had stolen my fear so I could go on to reach the end.\n\nCountless lives I\u2019ve been searching on to find the future that together we\u2019d stay\nI never forgot that awkward smile you showed me it\u2019s been pushing me on even to this day.\nCause if you lose your way from the path you came and scatter far along the wind\nI swear that I\u2019ll find you I will never give in I\u2019ll start along on the road again.\nKeep humming this song as many lives it will take for us to finally reach the end.\n\n\nInstrumental can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKu_r1MwX5k\n\nSupport me on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/willstetson\n\nFollow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/willstetson78\n\nI do not own the background image.",
