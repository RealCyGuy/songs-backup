        "description": "Sheet music \u2192 https://mymusic.st/animenzzz/62805\n\nHunter X Hunter (2011) was without a doubt one of the most amazing Shounen Anime I have ever seen and every single 148 episodes were absolutely worth watching. Especially the Chimera Ant Arc is so incredibly well done, it has become one of my favorite story arcs of all time. If anyone out there still haven't watched this Anime: Go and watch it now! (and avoid any spoilers on the internet)\nHonestly, after watching the final episode, I felt an emptiness I haven't felt for a very long time. It took me almost half a year to finish all episodes and it was hard to say goodbye to the characters I grew to love. Hunter X Hunter has eventually become one of my top 10 favorite Anime series I have ever watched and this week, I am really happy to present you the special-type piano arrangement for the opening song!\n\nI was quite surprised that Hunter X Hunter has been keeping the same opening song (with some variations) for all 148 episodes. But the song was so catchy I almost never skipped it while watching the Anime. But unlike the original song, this piano arrangement starts with a slower version of the chorus melody because I wanted to introduce the song with a nostalgic atmosphere. At 00:49, the second part of this arrangement begins and it describes the humble beginning of the protagonist. The melody is played in a carefree manner and it's slowly building up its momentum.\n\nAnd finally, 02:07 is the turning point of this arrangement. I was imagining the sunrise suddenly appearing in the horizon (similar to the Anime opening animation), signalizing the start of a big adventure. From this point on, the piece continues with its original upbeat tempo until the end.\nA special mention also deserves 04:14. If you have seen the Anime, I was imagining Gon and [spoiler character] sitting at the top of the world tree and just looking at the amazing scenery in front of them. That's why the music has suddenly calmed down at this part and the chorus melody is being played in the highest voice possible.\n\nI was also thinking how to bring this arrangement to a satisfying conclusion. I decided to go with a big orchestra finale in 05:09, because I want to bid farewell to the vast world of Hunter X Hunter. But at the same time, I am still optimistic that the journey will continue ... one day... perhaps... eventually... (please Togashi sensei, return from your hiatus...)\n\nAnyway, that would be this week's upload! I hope you enjoyed these special type arrangements I am doing once in a while. They are usually arranged in a more freely manner and they always tell a whole story with the music alone. I hope this time I could do the same.\n\nSee you next week then!\nI wonder what piece I should arrange next...\n\nAnimenz\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nMy facebook page:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Animenz\nFollow me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/Animenzzz\nI am using Instagram as well!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/animenz_official/\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nPiano arrangement by Animenz\nOriginal Song: Departure!\nAnime: Hunter X Hunter (2011) / \u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u00d7\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc (2011)\nPublished by: VAP (2011)\nComposed by: Hitoshi Haba / \u7fbd\u5834 \u4ec1\u5fd7\nPerformed by: Masatoshi Ono / \u5c0f\u91ce \u6b63\u5229\n\n#departure! #HunterXHunter #piano",
