        "description": "My finger slipped and I went viral on Twitter. Oops. I didn't want to put this vertical video up on my channel, but it's being posted by other people, so here you go.\n\nChords:\nAm7 - Dm7 - G7 - C\nF - B half diminished 7 - E7 - Am7\nDm7 - G7 - C/E - A7 - C#dim7\nDmin7 - G7 - C9 - E7\n\nMy new album: https://album.link/i/1539838024\nStalk me!\nTikTok: goingspaceward\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thustweetsdavid\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/goingspaceward\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/going-spaceward\n\nLYRICS:\nThey say that every day, the universe expands\nand we discover certain things that we don't understand.\nDark matter ain't the only mystery at hand.\nI'm wond'rin' how I got a girl like you to say that I'm her man.\n\nIt's a statistical anomaly, but girl, you've got me.\nGravity is pulling me to your heavenly body.\nNo astronomical phenomenon could ever stop me.\nYou've got a smile that every star in the galaxy copied.\n\nThe constellations couldn't make as beautiful a pattern.\nThe conversations\u2014every night, I ring you up like Saturn.\nThe telescopes tell us folks that you're the coolest view.\nA supernova's scootin' over to make room for you\n\n'cause you eclipse every wonder of the cosmos.\nIt's almost unfair to them, but you're the one I want most.\nIt's a miracle that Galileo never found you.\nIf he did, he'd say the universe revolved around you.",
