Having gone through a rough childhood, he has lackadaisical hate towards life and pretty much dedicates himself only to gaming. One day, both he and his sister are called into an alternate world after they defeat Tet in an online chess game. Sora's biological father (no relation to Shiro) married Shiro's biological mother (no relation to Sora), thus, making Shiro and Sora step-siblings. He lives with Shiro and was abandoned by his parents at a young age. After that, Sora pledged to be there for his sister no matter what.",
