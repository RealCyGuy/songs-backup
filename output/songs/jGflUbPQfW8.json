The smash dance song has notched more than 90 million Spotify streams, topping iTunes in 14 territories, including Germany, Australia, Sweden and others (Top 10 in nearly 30 other markets).  Released in 2012, a cleverly understated remix by German DJ/Producer Felix Jaehn helped power the global momentum building around the infectious track.\n\n\u201cCheerleader\u201d originally took off in Hawaii, but Omi was getting a larger sense of the song\u2019s \u2018stickiness\u2019 where ever he performed it live.  \u201cPeople just gravitated to it, always remarking how it was their favorite.\u201d  Felix Jaehn\u2019s 2014 remix added to the combustible nature of the track,\u201d but by deftly imbuing acoustic gestures into the mix \u2013 conga, piano, trumpet \u2013 embellishing its unornamented feel.  \u201cI loved the mix even before it took off,\u201d says Omi. \u201cSo calm;  And unusual for a remix, it made you want to listen to the words, too.\u201d\n\nfrom Ultra Records\n\nSubscribe to Ultra Records  - http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ultrarecords\nSubscribe to UltraTV  - http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ultratv\n\nFounded in 1995, Ultra has been home to some of the most legendary names in electronic music like MK, Benny Benassi, Armin van Buuren, Steve Aoki, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Black Coffee, deadmau5, Kygo, Ti\u00ebsto, Kaskade, SOFI TUKKER, and many more. \u200bAt the end of 2021 Ultra Records was acquired by Sony Music, and David Waxman \u2013 who previously held the title of Head of A&R and General Manager \u2013 was appointed President. \"Ultra Records will continue to deliver exceptional electronic music to the masses.\"\u200b\n\nFollow Us:\nhttps://www.ultrarecords.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@ultrarecords\nhttps://discord.gg/ultrarecords\nhttps://www.twitter.com/ultrarecords\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ultrarecordsofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ultrarecordsofficial/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ultrarecords\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/ultramusicofficial",
