        "description": "Sheet music \u2192 https://mymusic.st/animenzzz/64657\n\nSpy\u00d7Family is one of my favorite anime series of this season and the more I listened to the ending song, the more I wanted to play it on the piano. There are many interesting Jazz chords in this piece and I learned a lot about Jazz while arranging this song.\n\nSometimes I prefer to \u201capproximate\u201d the jazz chords in order to make them sound less dissonant. A good example would be the chord progression in 1:26 with slightly modified chords. I guess the \"classical music\" inside me is still trying to make it sound as \"smooth\" as possible. But at the end of the day, the goal is to make an arrangement which is pleasant to listen.\n\n\u2460 Staccato is king 0:04\nTo keep the relaxed atmosphere of the original song, I paid a lot of attention to emphasize the distinctive staccato sound in the right hand. The pedal is almost never used in 0:04 and 1:32 to make the piano sound as \u201clightweight\u201d as possible.  \n\n\u2461 Anya\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d scene in 2:31\nThe staccato and the accentuated rhythm is the driving force behind this arrangement. But the bridge part in 2:31, a gentle left hand arpeggio is being introduced and the whole atmosphere has changed into a dreamlike state. I was particularly inspired by the ED animation from Spy X Family, where Anya was floating in the sky at the end (while still dreaming). \n\n\u2462 The jazzy \u201cFinale\u201d in 3:28\nThe final chorus in 2:58 starts very soft but with each repeat of the melody, a new texture is being added into the arrangement. Eventually it evolves into a jazzy improvisation in 3:28, acting as a finale for this piece. I was imagining that Anya is dancing happily in 3:28 without any care in the world. (I think at this point, I might be too obsessed with Anya. But we need to protect her smile. At. All. Cost.)  \n\nSince I have been working on jazzy pieces recently, I think it's time to upload a new video on my second YouTube Channel with another classic jazz song this month.\n My second channel\ud83c\udfb9 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0gsaCgCAfE9lhYtSLPF7w\n\nWell then, thank you for listening to my piano arrangement of Kigeki! Next time, I will upload a frequently requested song from Shounen anime which I haven't arranged yet on this main channel. Can you guess which song?\n\nSee you then!\nAnimenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n\ud83d\udce3My Social Media\n\nFollow me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/Animenzzz\nI am using Instagram as well!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/animenz_official/\nMy Facebook page:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Animenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n\ud83c\udfb9Piano arrangement by Animenz\n\nOriginal Song: Kigeki (Comedy) / \u559c\u5287\nAnime: SPY\u00d7FAMILY\nPublished by: SPEEDSTAR RECORDS (2022)\nComposed by: Gen Hoshino\nPerformed by: Gen Hoshino\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n#spyxfamily #kigeki #genhoshino #SxF",
