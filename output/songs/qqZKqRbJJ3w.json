I really think it's fits the song very well! I hope you guys think so as well haha\nSeeing how well the guitar worked with this remix, it gets me excited to use guitar more in future lofi songs!! I'll be sure to include it in some more projects!\nAlso, is it me or does this arrangement give you big city jazz vibes?\n\nI am a bit behind scedule so I might not be able to make the Sunday deadline for my Centimeter remix. I'll let you guys know as the deadline gets closer!! Sorry! I've been a bit busy irl lately.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nAlso, thank you guys so much for the insane support of my kimi no sei lofi remix!
