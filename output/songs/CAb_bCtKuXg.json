Such a beautiful day\nThe sun\u2019s shining in a beautiful way\ngonna take a shower, brush my teeth and\nLife is ultimately meaningless\n....Uhh (cough)...\n\nbut I'll get out of the house\nGet on the road, top down, hands out\nPut on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm\nThe planet\u2019s being destroyed by your carbon emissions\n\nBut I- I- , I\u2019ll head to class\ntry my best on every test til I pass\nand my grades are screaming in my face - Ayyyy\n98 percent of what you learn is a waste. \n\nI get to hang out with all my friends\nMy friends are the friendliest friends\nCan't think of a better way to spend my time\nYour brain is flawed and all your friends will die\nNevermind!\n\nI\u2019m alive in the greatest nation!\nSo proud of- the exploitation of natives\nThis graceful bird means freedom for all\nTell that to the slaves and bald eagles aren't bald\n\nI can live in the moment, milk every second\nat any time you could get clinical depression\nBut I'll just be happy, no matter what\u2019s in store\nit\u2019s quite genetic and we have no cure \nuhh- at least\n\n(CHORUS )\nWe are young \nnot for long\nLife is fun\nIt only goes downhill\nWe gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it \nor you'll regret it\nWe are young \nFor now\nLife is fun \nfor some people\nWe gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it\nGood luck\n\nWoo! I got a brand new job today!\nDoin stuff that'll help the economy\nI'll save money and buy things at the store\nBanks can crash and capitalism is flawed\n\nAnd it\u2019s all because of my hard work\nAnd the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth\nI put a lotta effort in my resume!\nGood thing you don't have a black person\u2019s name\n\nI'm proud to be a functioning member of society\nFinally, I can be the citizen I dream to be\npart of the community, contribute with my tax\nWhat could possibly stop me?\nThe shrinking middle class\n\nI\u2019ve at least got a nice stable job\nUntil it\u2019s outsourced to china or replaced by a robot\nOH GOD- Well then I could relax a bit\nYou'll be empty with nothing to distract from it\n\nBut man I'm a passionate graduate \nI can be different and I have a career paths to pick from\nI could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky\nNeither of those will make you happy, trust me\n\nI'm able to choose what I pursue\nYou're a slave to people born richer than you\nThen screw it, I'll keep going in \nthen I'll party on the weekend and sing\n\nThanks to autotune \n\n(CHORUS )\n\nLife is a wonder\nYou\u2019ll never know the answer\n\nNature is a miracle\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s good to be alive\nYou could wake up with cancer\n\nBut I'm healthy\nHealthy people still get cancer\n\nI love this show\nIt\u2019s the last episode\n\nThe sun is shining\nIt\u2019s going to explode\n\nEvery species is beautiful and unique though\nChildren have malaria thanks to mosquitoes\n\nI met a cute girl with a ponytail\nStatistically that relationship is going to fail\n\nI have a wonderful family, it\u2019s like no other\nYou're not special and one day you'll bury your mother\n\nNo matter what I can find a home!\nWe. Will. All. Die. Alone.\n\nThere\u2019s amazing potential in every human on earth\nThere\u2019s no escaping the heat death of the universe\n\nI don't have to live life based on negative parts\nNo matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts\n\nYeah that\u2019s fair\nwait really?\nyeah that seems reasonable\nwait-wait-wait-wait but you were just telling me\nwhatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want,\nI'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying.\nOh...Well in that case...\n\n(CHORUS )",
