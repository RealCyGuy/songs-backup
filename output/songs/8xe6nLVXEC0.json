        "description": "What I learned in school vs. What I didn't learn in school.   \niTunes: http://goo.gl/n4EgkZ | Bandcamp: http://goo.gl/gDetLT\nI can't remember feeling so passionate whilst writing something in ages.   I absolutely love a lot of the subjects I mention in this - astronomy, particle physics, pure maths... but I hate that everyone is forced to learn them.   It should be a choice.   There are a million other things wrong with education, but this one stood out as the most obvious and most insane.\n\nThe point of this song is to get people talking - if you share it, use #DontStayInSchool so we can all get involved in the conversation.   \n\nLyrics:\nI wasn\u2019t taught how to get a job\nbut I can remember dissecting a frog\nI wasn\u2019t taught how to pay tax\nbut I know loads about Shakespeare's classics\n\nI was never taught how to vote\nthey devoted that time to defining isotopes\nI wasn\u2019t taught how to look after my health\nbut mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell \n\nNever spent a lesson on current events \ninstead I studied The Old American West\nI was never taught what laws there are.\nI was never taught what laws there are.\n\nLet me repeat - I was not taught the laws for the country I live in,\nbut I know how Henry the VIII killed his women.\nDivorced beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived\nglad that\u2019s in my head instead of financial advice\n\nI was shown the wavelengths of different hues of light\nbut I was never taught my human rights\n Apparently there\u2019s 30, do you know them?   I don\u2019t\nWhy the hell can\u2019t we both recite them by rote?!\n\nI know igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks\nYet I don\u2019t know squat about trading stocks\nOr how money works at all - where does it come from?\nWho controls it?   How does the thing that motivates the world function?\n\nnot taught how to budget and disburse my earnings\nI was too busy rehearsing cursive.\nDidn\u2019t learn how much it costs to raise a kid or what an affidavit is\nbut I spent days on what the quadratic equation is\n\nnegative b plus or minus the square root of b squared \nminus 4ac over 2a\nThat\u2019s insane, that\u2019s absolutely insane.\nThey made me learn that over basic first aid\n\nHow to recognise the most deadly Mental disorders // or \ndiseases with preventable causes // How to buy a \nhouse with a mortgage // if I could afford it\n \u2018cause abstract maths was deemed more important \n\nthan advice that would literally save thousands of lives \nbut it\u2019s cool, \u2018cause now I could tell you if the number of unnecessary deaths caused by that choice was prime.\n\nNever taught present day practical medicines, \nbut I was told what the ancient hippocratic method is\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a headache, the pain is ceaseless\nwhat should I take?\u201d umm... maybe try some leeches?\n\n\u201cCould we discuss domestic abuse and get the facts\nor how to help my depressed friend with their mental state?\u201d\nUmmm... no  but learn mental maths\nbecause \u201cyou won\u2019t have a calculator with you every day!\u201d\n\nThey say it\u2019s not the kids, the parents are the problem\nThen if you taught the kids to parent that\u2019s the problem solved then!\nAll this advice about using a condom\nbut none for when you actually have a kid when you want one\n\nI\u2019m only fluent in this language, for serious?\nThe rest of the world speaks two, do you think I\u2019m an idiot?\nThey chose the solar over the political system\nSo like a typical citizen now I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m voting on\n\nwhich policies exist, or how to make them change\nmais oui, je parle un peu de Francais\nSo at 18, I was expected to elect a representative \nFor a system I had never ever ever ever been presented with\n\nBut I won\u2019t take it\nI\u2019ll tell everyone my childhood was wasted\nI\u2019ll share it everywhere how I was \u201ceducated\u201d\nAnd insist these pointless things\n#DontStayInSchool\n\u25ba Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/boyinabandcom\n\u25ba Twitter: http://twitter.com/DavePBrown\n\u25ba Tumblr: http://davebiab.tumblr.com/\n\u25ba Music: http://boyinaband.bandcamp.com\n\u25ba T-Shirts: http://boyinaband.bigcartel.com/ \n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n\nTHANKS TO MY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING ME!\n\u25ba Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/boyinaband\nBart aka FantasyIH, Ema Simpson, Thomas Lloyd, Vincent Olsen, Ofer Mustigman, Sergey Khegay, Lance Thackeray.",
