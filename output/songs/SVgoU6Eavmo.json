        "description": "Hi guys, \nThank you for watching this video. I am just a fan of Dream. Dream is the founder of the Dream Team SMP. He is also the de-facto military and diplomatic leader of the Dream SMP Faction. He served as the final antagonist of the Manberg vs Pogtopia War up until he was forced to surrender to Pogtopians. As of his intend to destroy L'Manberg with Technoblade and taking one of TommyInnit's discs, he serves as the main antagonist of the entire Dream SMP.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfb5Presets and samples:\n      \ud83c\udfb9 Dubstep: https://youtu.be/HnFbGcEteyE\n      \ud83c\udfb9 Melodic Dubstep: https://bit.ly/2YhCKTb\n\nJoin the Discord server: https://discord.gg/WsgGrA6b2s\n\n\ud83c\udfb5Subscribe for more content. \n\nSee you guys soon\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f\nSupport me if you like\ud83e\udd11: https://www.patreon.com/zowexmusic\n\n\nThink of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.\n\n#flstudiomobile #music #presetsandsamples",
