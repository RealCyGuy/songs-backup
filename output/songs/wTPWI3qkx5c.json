        "description": "!! BEST WITH HEADPHONES !!\nmy discord server!! https://discord.gg/Cs7Fb8Rz6h\n\nart by @ soytastesbad on twitter! https://twitter.com/soytastesbad\ni only extended it to make it 1920 x 1080 and I made the hair and petals wave :)\n\nokok i said no more music edits but sometimes something is just so good you can't NOT make it. i also did want to get a video out. another video besides this should be coming soon :) \nalso thank you so much for 3k subs, i appreciate it!!\n\nthis is no Minecraft Manhunt. nor is it a Dream Challenge, or a Speedrun. In this video I will also not say whether Dream Cheated or Not, this is simply a Heatwaves in 8d and slowed after the beat drop video. Neither Tommyinnit nor Tommyinnit's ghost will not pop up on the screen halfway through. neither will Tubbo, or Technoblade, or GeorgeNotFound, or Sapnap, or Ranboo, or Wilbur Soot, or Dream Minecraft, or BadBoyHalo, or Skeppy, or any other Dream SMP Members. It also does not feature any MCYT TikToks or anything like that. This is simply an Aesthetic 8d and slowed edit of Heatwaves, which is a song commonly associated with Dreamnotfound (lmfaooo)",
