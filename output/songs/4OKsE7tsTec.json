        "description": "CONTENT WARNING: This is total whiplash from what I usually post. Just wanna let you know, there are some crude words and some heavy topics in this song.\n\nBo has now officially been sung on this channel. Here's a K.K. Slider cover of Welcome to the Internet from Bo Burnham's special \"Inside\", in honor of the Inside Outtakes releasing a couple days ago. The whole song is remade with Animal Crossing instruments, and I found that there was also a fart in the soundfont for some reason. You're welcome.\n\nWe also hit 1k subs, which is absolutely stupid crazy. Thanks a ton for each and every one of you for watching and sticking around over the years, and I apologize if this video is a bit too weird for a lot of you new viewers out there. Nonetheless, I hope you like it. This song, along with the whole album, has been looping in my head ever since it released a year or two ago.\n\nDOWNLOAD LINKS to all my songs!\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZOH0X_4vr_qrATFvRwT85Of1gKETrj1?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Discord: https://discord.gg/pbZhzbkr6g\n\ud83d\udfe2 Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/4348dQys5QYSJijuVsk3uL?si=5Ezh2XOjTbm_mIZQcSoVsw\n\u2615 Here's my tip jar! https://ko-fi.com/waddoop\n\nI also do commissions!
