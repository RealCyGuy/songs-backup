The songs he wrote for and with Queen filled stadiums around the globe and have rightly gone down in history, but he also embarked on a solo career that took him from the clubs of Munich and New York to the great opera houses of the world.\n \nHe was the ultimate showman, but he kept his private life away from the prying eyes of the media; a larger than life rock star who loved disco, classical music and ballet. He was a restless spirit, a true chameleon who revelled in his own contradictions.\n \nAll the different sides of this iconic musician can be found on Freddie Mercury: Messenger Of The Gods - The Singles. All formats released September 2nd 2016.\n\nThis memorable video, Directed by David Mallet, accompanied Freddie Mercury's seventh solo single. This is a cover version originally recorded by The Platters in the 1960s. The two 'lady' backing vocalists are none other than Freddie's good friends Peter Straker and a certain Mr Roger Taylor, from a band called Queen. The single was released in the UK on 23 February 1987.\n\nSubscribe to the official Freddie Mercury Solo channel here: https://FreddieMercury.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://FreddieMercury.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Freddie Mercury Solo:\nFreddie Mercury; lead singer of Queen and solo artist in his own right.
