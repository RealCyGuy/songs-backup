Only the heroic members of the Scouting Legion dared to stray beyond the safety of the walls \u2013 but even those brave warriors seldom returned alive. Those within the city clung to the illusion of a peaceful existence until the day that dream was shattered, and their slim chance at survival was reduced to one horrifying choice: kill \u2013 or be devoured!\n\nCrunchyroll brings you the latest clips, openings, full episodes, and more from your favorite anime!\n\nFREE 14-DAY CRUNCHYROLL TRIAL \ud83c\udf1f https://got.cr/cc-14daysop\n\n#AttackonTitan #Anime #Crunchyroll",
