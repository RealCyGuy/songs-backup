        "description": "\u2665 Become a Patron and help choose my next cover! \u2665\nhttps://www.patreon.com/splendiferachie\n\nIt's been too long since Deco-sama uploaded a Miku song, thank you 10th anniversary...\n\nI\u2019ve been in love with this song ever since its release!! It\u2019s one of the only songs that\u2019s gotten me pumped up in a while now\u2026 other than Sand Planet of course.\n\nAll the hardships of writing a vocaloid song\u2026 I think it's needless to say that it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of vocaloid content creator you are, we all feel Miku\u2019s fickle love at some point and sometimes it can drive us insane.\n\nBut like the title mentioned, our love for her and the ideas we have prove to be a SPARK unlike any other that just won't burn out\u2026 not that I want to anyway hehe.\n\nDeco-sama chose to string together some motifs from several of his old songs to write this one! It's definitely ghost rule in the chorus and verses, rooter's song in the prechorus, and reversible campaign in the bridge! In the original lyrics there was also a reference in the \"NO\u3092\u7a7a\u632f\u3063\u305f\u611b\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\" which was from Ghost Rule's \"NO \u3060\u3063\u3066\u8a00\u3046\u7b48\u304c\u3000\u30ad\u30e7\u30c9\u3063\u3066 YES \u3092\u58f0\u306b\u51fa\u3059\", but it was a little clunky in english so i chose to leave it out ;;\n\nThank you so much to Rezyon for mixing this for me! I have no idea how he put up with my incessant nitpicking and vague statements. Please make sure to check out his channel and his original songs and covers! \n\nPS \u2729 for those who wanna cover it be sure to pay attention to the lyrics cause i changed a line slightly after recording and didn't want to rerecord oops (make it melt \u2192 make me melt)\n\n\n\n\u2729 S/O to my Patrons!! \u2729\nAlexander Q.E.\nArcel U.A.W\nAyano\nChristian W.\nDailyDubby\nIan K.\nMark B.\nMiraLuminous\nMr. Hat\nNatasha H.\nQuartz Q.\nRachiet\nReanne C.\nSniper94wolf\nSophic R.\nSpenser T.\nSuzie\n\n\n\nCredits \uff61.\uff61:+* \n\u25aa\ufe0e Original: deco*27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxSg2Ioz3LM\n\u25aa\ufe0e Arrangement: Rockwell (https://twitter.com/69l_rockwell)\n\u25aa\ufe0e Supervised English lyrics: Mes (https://twitter.com/MesC)\n\u25aa\ufe0e Art: HASSAN (https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=637197)\n\u25aa\ufe0e Mix: Rezyon (https://www.youtube.com/user/rezyon)\n\u25aa\ufe0e Lyrics, subs, translation: rachie (hi!!!)\n\n\n\nTalk to me~!.\uff61.:*\u266a\n\u2765 Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/splendiferachie\n\u2765 Tumblr: http://splendiferachie.xyz\n\u2765 Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/splendiferousfantasy\n\u2765 Instagram: http://instagram.com/splendiferachie\n\u2765 Email: rachie2525@rocketmail.com\n\n\n\u273f mp3 \u273f\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/file/duic1hyble6m442/HIBANA_%28English_Cover%29.mp3\n\n\n\u273b Lyrics \u273b (feel free to use wherever!)\n\nKnock knock, don\u2019t knock on the door too hard\nAnd get on board this war to take back my heart\nMy chest is beating in overtime\nDelusions flashing left and right, I wonder where the answer lies?\n\nNow, come and mute the complaints you have\nYou\u2019re hanging back because of the things you lack\nYou\u2019re only joking right? Ahaha\nYou try to break this wall to bits instead it goes in for a kiss\n\n\u201cLike you\u2019d ever get that\u201d\n\u201cSurely now you understand!\u201d\nI\u2019ll shoot a bullet right between those eyes\n\nI\u2019ve had enough, this love will never end, see?\nMake me worry, make me hate it more\nIt\u2019s not enough, I need you to surprise me\nMake me feel so I can know for sure\n\nnanana\nI\u2019ve said it\u2019s incomplete so many times, hey\nnanana\nTrapped inside a love I know I can\u2019t escape\n\nTap tap, we\u2019re even, with that we\u2019re tied\nHiding myself away from your eyes that time \nBut still, the perfectionist deep in me\nIs echoing a lonely scream, so dizzy in monotony\n\nKnock knock! Let me come in and take the ace\nYou'll paint your face with tears that don't feel the same\nNow heart reinforcement is up, don\u2019t play\nYou'd better give up and throw your MP5 away\n\nMaybe if I take both\nMaybe if I break both\nWhichever one I choose it\u2019s me I lose\n\nIt\u2019s way too tough, I\u2019ll let go of this love now\nMake it painful, make it hurt me more\nIt\u2019s way too fun, it hurts to even laugh now\nMake me melt so I can see for sure\n\nnanana\nI\u2019ve said it\u2019s incomplete so many times, hey\nnanana\nTrapped inside a love I know I can\u2019t escape\n\n\u201cLike you\u2019d ever get that\u201d\n\u201cSurely now you understand!\u201d\nI\u2019ll shoot a bullet right between those eye s\nBetween those eyes\n\nI\u2019ve had enough, this love will never end, see?\nMake me worry, make me hate it more\nIt\u2019s not enough, I need you to surprise me\nMake me feel so I can know for sure\n\nnanana\nI\u2019ve said it\u2019s incomplete so many times, hey\nnanana\nTrapped inside a love I know I can\u2019t escape\n\nIt\u2019s way too tough, I\u2019ll let go of this love, now\nMake it painful, make it hurt me more\nIt\u2019s way too fun, it hurts to even smile now\nMake me melt so I can see for sure\n\nnanana\nI\u2019ve said it\u2019s incomplete so many times, hey\nnanana\nTrapped inside a love I know I can\u2019t escape\n\nnanana\nI\u2019ve said it\u2019s incomplete so many times, hey\nnanana\nTrapped inside a love I know I can\u2019t escape",
