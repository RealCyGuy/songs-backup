        "description": "why not, challenge accepted\n\n\"Because it was mediocre, no offense.\" Merch: https://www.themeeksduo.com/merchandise/fanchen-collection\n\nRead description for plot update!\nFirst, go show some love to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utYanxGgTww\nDon't spread hate.\nUnfortunately the legendary comment thread has been deleted due to the closing of Prolitening's previous school account. Nevertheless, please go support his new channel!\n\n\nI also thank the lord Jesus Charlie himself for blessing this video https://youtu.be/foSAi-olfck\n\nFor those who are wondering, the plot had achieved a *good ending* status. Try to find Hen\\*ai guy\u2019s comment in Cr1tikal\u2019s video. We\u2019re basically married now.\n\nMy idea of mediocrity is that it had room for improvement, it was not bad. Wasn\u2019t trying to insult the performance, just an honest opinion. Obviously could have worded that better though! Prolitening told me he understood my intentions were not hostile, so we pals now. Stay tuned for potential collab!\n\nEdit 2: The potential collab is happening! Come check out the Ultimate Rush E for 8 hands! Featuring @litening5826, @TheMeeksDuo, and myself!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbEBrMZ-G_k\n\nPiece: Rush E\nOriginal: Composed by Andrew Wrangell\nSlight modification by me",
