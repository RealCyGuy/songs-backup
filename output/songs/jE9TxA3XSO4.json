        "description": "This is our NEW 2020 cover of Fukashigi no Carte, the ED for Rascal Does not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai! \n\nSTREAM: https://lnkfi.re/FukashiginoCarte\n\nI can finally say\u2026 after 2 years\u2026 let's bring this song to Spotify!!! Thank you guys all so much for the love on our original 2018 version, but because that version used the official instrumental, I was not able to do so. But because of the amazing instrumental work of Brandon Yates, we're able to go for it now! \n\nThis is a totally remastered version of the previous cover with updated lines and (hopefully) upgraded audio quality - I really hope you guys enjoy! \n\nPlease give a big thank you and send lots of love again to all of the amazing vocalists who were kind enough to join me in this project \u2661 \n\nEeveeon: http://bit.ly/2PpVigS\nIN0RI: http://bit.ly/2ON4Frk\nAirahTea: http://bit.ly/2qdrjKO\nMari: http://bit.ly/2OSjgBV\nLuciana.a: http://bit.ly/2EMFXTo\n\nRepeat extra special love to Eeveeon for the harms, Eeveeon for the translation and zzz - Anime on Piano for extra help with the translation ^^)/\n\nIf you enjoyed this cover, please consider liking and subscribing!

All of this is really true?\nand they're just blind?\n\u00a0\nAm I just talking to myself?\nTake it slow, please don't overwork yourself\nAll I want is to have your love\n\u00a0\nI'll say goodbye, I think it's time, as all the lights spin\nWill I survive if you're not here with me?\nIt's written down in words no one can read\nI want to know, but should I really see? \n\u00a0\nBeating hearts, living in this world\nAnd it hurts when you can't be next to me\nWon't you return?\n\u00a0\nEvery night, I will make a wish \nIt's so clear, I just want to be with you\nI beg you, please make this come true\n\u00a0\nIt's so absurd, but it's so real, I can't believe it\nfilled with regret, cause you're not here with me\nIt's written down in words no one can read\nStuck on repeat, seemingly endlessly \n\u00a0\nAnd a voice calls out to me\nAm I waking from this dream?\nIs it beautiful?\nShould I be careful?\nIs this what I want? \nWell, hey\nTell me!\n\u00a0\nI cannot speak, I cannot sleep, stuck in a daydream \nThe one I see, is it reality?\nIt's written down in words I cannot read\nI want to know, I only want to see\n\u00a0\nAnd now I'm stuck, there's no way out, here in this daydream\nStranded and lost, between realities\nIt's written down in words I cannot read\nTime passing by, heart beating fast, as I want to know\nI need to know, but should I really see?",
