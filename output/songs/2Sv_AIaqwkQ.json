        "description": "It's definitely a new and special experience for me to try a two pianos arrangement (first time on a FULL VERSION BGM as well). I barely arrange for two pianos because it's very hard to record and arrange as well. Even tho I have done two pianos in the past or even for subjects in uni, it's still a very new experience to arrange something for myself to play. I have to keep trying recording the part I arranged and play the other part with it to see if it sounds good. \n\nOne thing I have noticed when I finialize the arrangement is I found a lot of uncessary chords (or too many notes) when it's together, lots of elements are uncessary which only make the arrangements sound messy. So i have to change around again to make it just right amount of notes and sound the same time to be able to voice each line together. \n\nThe original music has a very long intro (not sure if it is a intro) where the texture gets fuller and fuller each phrase when more instruments added in. It's bit difficult on the piano because all the tones sound the same. It will clash sometimes.\n\nI really love the parts where the guitar enters, sadly I tried my best to play it on the piano. It's different instruments so I (or you) can't really expect it to produce the same feeling from it. For my personal perference, I like the part where the electric guitar starts to play. It really made the whole music into next level. Where all classical instruments (especially Organ and Harpsichord from the baroque) combined with the modern instruments. And scales part where different voices call and response made it really cool.\n\nI hope you will like this arrangement, which I actually worked til 5am on Friday LOL.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSheet Music: \nhttps://chaconnescott.gumroad.com/l/saxnq\n\nDifficulty: 3.5-4 for piano I and 4-4.5 for Piano II,  to record it together, I would say 5/5\n\n(The difficulty is only rated according to my OWN arrangements so people can know it before they tried to learn it. I set my hardest arrangements as 5/5 and the easist as 1/5.  It doesn't represent the difficulty of average piano arrangements on Youtube.)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to to the discord channels below \n1.
