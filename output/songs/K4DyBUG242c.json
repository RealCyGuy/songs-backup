Daniel Levi\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold me close 'til I get up\nTime is barely on our side\nI don't wanna waste what's left\nThe storms we chase are leadin' us\nAnd love is all we'll ever trust, yeah\nNo, I don't wanna waste what's left\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\n'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\nAnd on and on we'll go\nOn we'll go\n\n[Verse 2]\nFinding life along the way\nMelodies we haven't played\nNo, I don't want no rest\nEchoin' around these walls\nFighting to create a song (yeah)\nI don't wanna miss a beat\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\n'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\nAnd on and on we'll go\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd we'll grow in number\nFuelled by thunder, see the horizon\nTurn us to thousands\nAnd we'll grow in number\nFuelled by thunder, see the horizon\nTurn us to thousands\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\n'Til my shadow turns to sunrays\nAnd on and on we'll go\nThrough the wastelands, through the highways\nAnd on and on we'll go\n\n\n\u00a9 Check out our Usage Policy on how to use NCS music in your videos: http://ncs.io/UsagePolicy\n\nTo request a commercial license visit: http://ncs.io/Commercial",
