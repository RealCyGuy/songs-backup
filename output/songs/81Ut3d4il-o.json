        "description": "Sheet music \u2192 https://mymusic.st/animenzzz/63849\n\nA very elegant person is playing the piano. \nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the video description.\n\nCoincidentally, the concert outfit I am always wearing for my videos proves to be very useful now and I can finally feel the true meaning of \u201celegance\u201d for the very first time. Thank you Spy X Family for enlightening me!\n\n\u300cMixed Nuts\u300d from Official Hige Dandism is an insanely fun piece to play on the piano and I simply love the groovy bassline of the song. Once again, I tried to combine as many musical elements from the original piece as possible without needing more than 2 hands. (Sometimes I wish I have three hands though)\n\nThe beginning part in 0:08 (aka the car chase in the opening animation) is literally chaos incarnate on the piano and honestly, I have no idea what I was actually playing\u2026 I actually wanted to smash the keys randomly but at the end I still created some sort of a pattern. I guess the inner perfectionism in me doesn\u2019t allow completely randomized piano patterns after all, haha. \n\nThis piece is essentially a piano etude for the left hand because of the fast octave bassline in 0:18 which requires a lot of stamina and focus to play. But I loved playing the octave bass line so much I even played it again for the final chorus in 2:46. \n\nOne of my favorite moments in the arrangement is actually the small top melody in 0:29. The joy and playfulness in this moment perfectly captures the positive nature of Anya from Spy X Family. I have to say, Official Hige Dandism is really amazing for composing a song, which fits perfectly well with the theme of the anime. \n\nAlright, thank you for reading the video description for this week!\nI still haven\u2019t decided what I will upload as my next video but after recording this groovy arrangement I am more motivated than ever to create elegant arrangements!\n\nSee you next time again!\n\nAnimenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n\ud83d\udce3My Social Media\n\nFollow me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/Animenzzz\nI am using Instagram as well!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/animenz_official/\nMy Facebook page:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Animenz\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n\ud83c\udfb9Piano arrangement by Animenz\n\nOriginal Song: MIXED NUTS\nAnime: SPY\u00d7FAMILY\nPublished by: PONY CANYON (2022)\nComposed by: Official HIGE DANdism\nPerformed by: Official HIGE DANdism\n------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*------*\n#spyxfamily #mixednuts #officialhigedandism #higedan #SxF",
