My stomach\u2019s full and satisfied\n\nBut suddenly it was apparent, you weren\u2019t a peanut, shell gone from sight\nAnd everyone disappeared from your side; no one else remained, they thought that you weren\u2019t right\nBut that was when I stood beside you, hoping to earn your love and praise\nSo through thick, and through thin, you and I, we can face them all\nBoth our shells they will become unbreakable\n\nWhether you were born in the ground or in a tree skyward bound, it doesn\u2019t make any difference yet to me\nNo we\u2019re all the same, all we need is sun and rain to survive in this world\nLet\u2019s make this barren land a fresh and hopeful place to be\n\nGazing outside, the weather\u2019s frightful, freezing and wet I watch it go, you know\nInside I\u2019m alright, storms are such a delight, \u2018cause there\u2019ll always be days where all the stars, they won\u2019t shine\nNow let this life go by, surprises can happen in this show, and I know\nAnything could happen but it is what it is, that I know\nI\u2019ll just enjoy it while it lasts, and never let it go\n\nConstantly choking back our secrets, lying abound; but it\u2019s my home, you know\nNow we can try to fill our stomachs inside, with a great home-cooked meal, or something plain from outside\nNow nothing is assured, and everything changes in this life, and I know\nNow every day\u2019s so mediocre, boring and plain, passing by\nBut really I don\u2019t even mind, \u2018cause you are by my side\nNow the truth is out, it feels so nice! My stomach\u2019s full and satisfied\nI\u2019ll keep on going through this miracle with you, this little something we call life!",
