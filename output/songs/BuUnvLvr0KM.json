        "description": "This theme song is so good.\n\nTAB: https://emile07.gumroad.com/l/kbBIx\nTuning: Half step down, Capo 1 (can also play in Standard but it's easier to do the stretched chords with the capo on first fret)\n\nTip for learning the intro strumming part (which i heard was the hardest part for most people): \nYou have to curve your left-hand fingers (also thumb over the low E string) in such a way so that you are muting the other strings and only the ones mentioned in the tab should ring out. That's only half of it though, also try to be as precise as possible with your right-hand strum technique. The way I do it is to bring my index and thumb together to form like a pick and then, any downstroke is hit using index nail and upstroke is hit using thumb nail. Any little slaps in between the strums are mainly hit using the flat part of the thumb but try to still keep the pick-like form when doing it so that you can easily transition to the next strum.\n\nGenshin covers playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdNABDk39DDb8T7yPOzyoCmnkpFOxrJcf\n\nGuitar: Taylor gs mini\n\n#eulatheme #genshinimpact #guitar",
