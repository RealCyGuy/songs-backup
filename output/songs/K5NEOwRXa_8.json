You may have seen us doing viral stunts in the middle of the street with our red couch, to help spread our music! We produce, write, sing, mix and master all of our songs, and we love showcasing this music in a fun and humorous way through public pranks and performances in the middle of the street. We love to see how people react!\n\nIf you like musicians like Maroon 5, Harry Styles, Bruno Mars, Stellar, Imagine Dragons, Glass Animals, Benson Boone you'll love our content and music! \n\nIf you like our music, or enjoy our singing content, feel free to hit that sub button for daily YouTube shorts and new music coming soon!\u2705\n\n#crashadams #givemeakiss",
